ðŸŒ† A lightweight & standalone LIMBO service for Minecraft.

_This project is forked from [LOOHP's Limbo](https://github.com/LOOHP/Limbo),
but will be breaking changed and maintained by [YourCraftMC](https://github.com/YourCraftMC)._

## Usage

Download latest server jars [here](https://github.com/YourCraftMC/LimboService/releases/latest)
or other versions from [Releases](https://github.com/YourCraftMC/LimboService/releases).

1. Put downloaded server jar file at a directory where you want to run the limbo server.
    - Also you can put the world scheme file to the same directory as limbo's world.
2. Use the following command lines to start the limbo server just like any other Minecraft server jars
   ```shell
   java -Xms64M -Xmx512M -jar Limbo.jar
   ```
3. Configure settings in `config.yml` and messages in `messages.yml`.
    - Also see `allowlist.yml` for allowing/disallowing players to join.
4. Join the server with configured host and enjoy the limbo!

## Development

You can find packages from GitHub Packages.

Remember to replace `VERSION` with the version you're using.
